Made by Gloria, Parmita, Elza, Verona

## Description
A Web API built around the sakila database, designed to provide a user-friendly interactive interface to navigate between the tables and complete basic CRUD operations with a click of a button. 

## How to use 
> Once the project has been cloned, make sure the application properties are set to the correct root and password of your particular database settings. Then run the main method in **Group2WebDevelopmentProjectApplication**. <br>
<sup>Default port is 8080, if your device doesn't have port 8080 free then do a refactor or find and replace everywhere which uses 8080</sup><br>
With the Project and database up and running you can do the following:

### Index
This is where you want start, use the url: http://localhost:8080/index to get to the index page and here you will see the differnt tables you can view. In this current version of the project you will be able to access the film and rentals table.

### Navigation 
Once entering one of the two tables you will be able to see the all the entries for the your chosen table. Every page will include a navigation bar at the top of the site where the user is able to navigate between the two tables with ease. On the right hand side of the nav bar there is a **Create** button that will allow you to create a new entry into the table you are currently viewing. <br>
